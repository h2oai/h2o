H\ :sub:`2`\ O on EC2
=====================

The H\ :sub:`2`\ O platform is tested nightly in EC2
for both single-node and multi-node configurations.

For users who want to quickly give H\ :sub:`2`\ O a try, we provide
an Amazon Machine Image to serve as an easy starting point.

The README.txt file embedded below describes scripts that can be found
in the EC2 directory of the downloadable zip file
:ref:`GettingStartedFromaZipFile`, or in the EC2 directory of the
Github repository :ref:`QuickstartGit`.
