**Step 2** 

  From your email account contact h2ostream@googlegroups.com with a
  brief description of the error you encountered, and your contact
  information. Attach the downloaded H\ :sub:`2`\ O logs downloaded
  from log view to the email before sending. 

**Step 3**  

  We will route your email to the correct engineer or data scientist
  and work to resolve your issue. 


Hadoop - Copy and Paste Your YARN Logs
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
In the event H\ :sub:`2`\ O fails to launch properly on Hadoop send us the YARN logs.

When launching H\ :sub:`2`\ O on Hadoop the following messages will show up first regardless of failure or success, otherwise the argument has not been entered correctly:

::

Other Common Troubleshooting Topics
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

**Common Question: Why is "Upload" is no longer working?**


This can occur when a userâ€™s local disk is full or almost full. 
Free up space on your local disk, and the behavior should resolve. 


**Common Question: I launched H2O instances on my nodes but why won't they cloud up?**

When launching without specifying the IP address by adding argument -ip:

::

  $ java -Xmx20g -jar h2o.jar -flatfile flatfile.txt -port 54321

and multiple local IP addresses are detected, H\ :sub:`2`\ O will fall back to default 127.0.0.1 as shown below:

::

  10:26:32.266 main      WARN WATER: Multiple local IPs detected:
  +                                    /198.168.1.161  /198.168.58.102
  +                                  Attempting to determine correct address...
  10:26:32.284 main      WARN WATER: Failed to determine IP, falling back to localhost.
  10:26:32.325 main      INFO WATER: Internal communication uses port: 54322
  +                                  Listening for HTTP and REST traffic on http://127.0.0.1:54321/
  10:26:32.378 main      WARN WATER: Flatfile configuration does not include self:
  /127.0.0.1:54321 but contains [/192.168.1.161:54321, /192.168.1.162:54321]

To avoid falling back to 127.0.0.1 on servers with multiple local IP addresses just run the command with the -ip argument forcing a launch at the appropriate location:

::

  $ java -Xmx20g -jar h2o.jar -flatfile flatfile.txt -ip 192.168.1.161 -port 54321

  
**Common Question: Why are my string entries being converted into NAs during Parse?**

At the moment columns with numeric values will have the string entries converted to NAs when the data is being ingested:

::

   Data Frame in R		Data Frame in H2O
	V1  V2  V3  V4		     V1  V2  V3  V4
   1     1   6  11   A		1     1   6  11  NA
   2	 2   B   A   A		2     2  NA  NA  NA
   3 	 3   A  13  18		3     3  NA  13  18
   4	 4   C  14  19		4     4  NA  14  19
   5     5  10  15  20		5     5  10  15  20

If the numeric values in the column were meant to be additional factor levels then you can concatenate the values with a string and the column will parse as a enumerator column:

::

	V1  V2  V3  V4
   1     1  i6 i11   A
   2     2   B   A   A
   3     3   A i13 i18
   4     4   C i14 i19
   5     5 i10 i15 i20



R and H\ :sub:`2`\ O
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

  In order for H\ :sub:`2`\ O and R to work together, an instance of
  H\ :sub:`2`\ O must be running, and that instance of H\ :sub:`2`\ O
  must be specified in the R workspace. If the H\ :sub:`2`\ O instance
  is terminated the H\ :sub:`2`\ O package in R will no longer work
  because R will no longer be able to send information to 
  H\ :sub:`2`\ O's distributed analysis, and will no longer be able to
  get info mation back. Even if a new instance of H\ :sub:`2`\ O is
  started with the exact same IP and port number, users
  will need to reestablish the connection between  H\ :sub:`2`\ O and R
  using the call h2o.init(), and will have
  to restart their H\ :sub:`2`\ O work session. 
  

**Updating the R Package aka. Avoid Version Mismatch!**

H\ :sub:`2`\ O's R package is now available for download on CRAN but typically the 0xdata team continues to push new releases faster than CRAN typically upload more recent packages. To avoid a version mismatch when upgrading or changing your version of H\ :sub:`2`\ O in R please run through the following steps :

#. Close any Java instances up to kill any rogue H\ :sub:`2`\ O instances that hasn't been properly shut down or terminated.

#. Uninstall previous version of H\ :sub:`2`\ O from R by running :

	::
    
	  if ("package:h2o" %in% search()) { detach("package:h2o", unload=TRUE) }
	  if ("h2o" %in% rownames(installed.packages())) { remove.packages("h2o") }

#. For Windows especially check to make sure there are no remanants of H\ :sub:`2`\ O in your personal R library.

#. Download and/or install the H\ :sub:`2`\ O package version by following the instructions in our R user documentation.

#. If you still run into trouble with h2o.init() try running in the terminal:

	::
  
	  $ java -Xmx1g -jar h2o.jar

#. Go back to R and try running h2o.init() again. If the problem persist please contact us at support@0xdata.com.


**Common Question: How Do I Manage Dependencies in R?**

The H\ :sub:`2`\ O R package utilizes other R packages (like lattice, and curl). From time to time
R will fail to download from CRAN and give an error. In that case it's best to get the binary from C
RAN directly and install the package manually using the call:

::

  >install.packages("path/to/fpc/binary/file", repos = NULL, type = "binary")

Users may find this page on installing dependencies helpful:

**Internal Server Error in R**
   

::
  
  brew install gnu-tar
  cd /usr/bin
  sudo ln -s /usr/local/opt/gnu-tar/libexec/gnubin/tar gnutar

H\ :sub:`2`\ O On Windows
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

**Using CMD Shell** as an alternative to using terminal for windows
users allows windows users to execute instructions as written for
installign and running H\ :sub:`2`\ O in general. 

In order to install and run R on Windows 8 (any and all R packages,
including those distributed by H\ :sub:`2`\ O) users will need read 
and write persmissions to   



Tunneling between servers with H\ :sub:`2`\ O
---------------------------------------------

**Step 1** 

Log in to the machine where H\ :sub:`2`\ O will run using ssh

**Step 2**

Start an instance of H\ :sub:`2`\ O by locating the working directory and 
calling a java command similar to the following ( the port number chosen here
is arbitrary and users might choose something different). 
::

 $ java -jar h2o.jar -port  55599

This returns output similar to the following: 

::

 irene@mr-0x3:~/target$ java -jar h2o.jar -port 55599
 04:48:58.053 main      INFO WATER: ----- H2O started -----

 04:48:58.247 main      INFO WATER: Log dir: '/tmp/h2ologs'

**Step 3** 

Log into the remote machine where the running instance of H\ :sub:`2` \O will be
forwarded using a command similar to the following (where users
specified port numbers and IP address will be different)

::

  ssh -L 55577:localhost:55599 irene@192.168.1.173

**Step 4**

Check cluster status

You are now using H\ :sub:`2`\O from localhost:55577, but the
instance of H\ :sub:`2`\O is running on the remote server (in this
case the server with the ip address 192.168.1.xxx) at port number 55599. 

To see this in action note that the web UI is pointed at
localhost:55577, but that the cluster status shows the cluster running
on 192.168.1.173:55599
